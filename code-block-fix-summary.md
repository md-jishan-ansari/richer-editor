# Code Block Language Selection Fix - Summary

## Problem
When a user created an empty code block and tried to select a language from the dropdown, the code block would be deactivated/removed, causing the language selection to fail.

## Root Cause
The issue was that TipTap's `updateAttributes` command was failing or causing the code block to be removed when the code block was completely empty (no content).

## Solution
**Prevent empty code blocks from being created in the first place.**

### Changes Made:

1. **Modified Code Block Toggle Button** in both `RicherEditor.tsx` and `SmallRicherEditor.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   // Before
   onClick={() => editor.chain().focus().toggleCodeBlock().run()}

   // After
   onClick={() => {
     if (editor.isActive('codeBlock')) {
       editor.chain().focus().toggleCodeBlock().run();
     } else {
       // Create a code block with a space to ensure it's not empty
       editor.chain().focus().toggleCodeBlock().insertContent(' ').run();
     }
   }}
   ```

2. **Kept Language Selection Simple**:
   - No complex state management
   - No manual state updates
   - Simple `updateAttributes` call

## Why This Works
- **Empty code blocks never exist**: Every code block has at least a space
- **Language changes work reliably**: `updateAttributes` works properly on non-empty code blocks
- **Simple and maintainable**: No complex state management or timing issues
- **User experience**: Users can still delete the space and add their own content

## Testing
1. Click the code block button → Creates a code block with a space
2. Select a language from the dropdown → Language is applied successfully
3. Delete the space and add code → Works normally
4. Code block remains active throughout the process

## Files Modified
- `src/components/RicherEditor.tsx` - Modified code block toggle button
- `src/components/SmallRicherEditor.tsx` - Modified code block toggle button

## Result
✅ Empty code blocks are never created
✅ Language selection works consistently
✅ Code blocks remain active when changing languages
✅ Simple and reliable solution
